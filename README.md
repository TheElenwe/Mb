You've consumed X amount of Mbps on Wikipedia and Y amount of Mbps on memes. The cost of visiting Wikipedia is 0,10$ per Mb and the cost for watching memes is 0,05$ per Mb. If total consumption is more than 100$ print "Too much consumption". If watching meme consumption is greater than reading wikipedia consumption print "WOW MANY MEMES", "SUCH LOL"(in new line).

Create a program that:

Reads X(wikipedia Mb consupmtion) and Y(watching meme Mb consumption)
Calculates the total consumption
If total consumption greater than 100$ print proper message
If watching meme consumption is greater than reading wikipedia articles print proper messages
